Lets get started to install and config minikube and wotk with it. minikube is a simplified enviroment for kubernetes for developers and learners and any one else that want to use kubernetes without any payment and also hard work for bare metal installation. i write a bash script ot automate all installation and validation process. 
feel free to costumize this script based on what you need and what you want to do. script at this point just can work on RedHat and Debian base systems. 


Just set executable access for this script and run it.
